# Summary

CollatriX is a graphical user interface (GUI) developed using PyQt5 to collate outputs from MorphoMetriX [@Torres:2020], a photogrammetric measurement GUI designed for morphometric analysis of wild animals from aerial imagery. For each image used in MorphoMetriX, a comma-separated-values sheet (.csv) is produced containing the custom measurements (length, area, angle) and their associated labels created by the user. Hence, projects with a large number of images in their morphometric analysis have a large number of output files, creating time-intensive and tedious workflows to manually combine output files into a single data file to be used in analysis. CollatriX was designed as a user-friendly GUI overcoming this limitation by collating these measurement outputs into a single data sheet (.csv) based on the animalâ€™s individual ID.

# Features

CollatriX works with MorphoMetriX outputs saved in any file structure format. A safety option was built in CollatriX to increase user efficiency in working through large image datasets while avoiding user input errors. MorphoMetriX automatically scales length measurements in pixels to real world values (i.e. meters) from manually entered altitude, focal length, and pixel dimension values. While this setup allows for each separate image to be scaled accordingly, there is potential for input errors when entering these values, especially when working through large datasets. CollatriX provides a safety option for users where the number of pixels in a length is back calculated, and the measurement is recalculated using the correct values per image from a user provided csv. CollatriX also has an option to select a subset of output csvs associated with a specified list of individuals.

In addition the main function, CollatriX has two additional functions. The first is an Unoccupied Aerial Systems (UAS) altitude calibration tool that uses the recommended method (Method 5) from @Burnett:2018. The tool uses measurements of a calibration object of known length to calculate the true altitude of the UAS, it then creates a linear model that is to calculate a corrected altitude of images taken throughout the flight. For more detail see @Burnett:2018. The output of this tool can be used as the safety for the main CollatriX function.
The second added function calculates two metrics of cetacean body condition. If the user used MorphoMetriX to measure perpendicular widths based on a length measurement, a common metric for assessing body condition in cetaceans [@Christiansen:2016; @Dawson:2017; @Burnett:2018], the tool can calculate body volume of the whale following @Christiansen:2018 and Body Area Index (BAI) following [@Burnett:2018]. BAI is a measure of dorsal surface area normalized by length, the CollatriX tool can calculate surface area using parabolas [@Burnett:2018] or trapezoids [@Christiansen:2016]. Because MorphoMetriX allows the user to specify the number of width segments, CollatriX provides the option for the user to specify the number of width segments, i.e. 20 widths (5% increments of the total length), as well as the minimum and maximum bound in which to calculate body volume (i.e. widths between 20-85% of total length).

Used together, MorphoMetriX and CollatriX provide a toolset that is easy to use and flexible. It is also easily adaptable to future projects because CollatriX was designed to easily incorporate other add-on tools. CollatriX has been used on MorphoMetriX outputs from several projects on a variety of cetacean species including bottlenose dolphins, Antarctic minke, dwarf minke, fin, blue, and humpback whales.
